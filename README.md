# UrlShortener
An implementation of a url shortener using .NET Core

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
### Introduction
This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configuration and deployment plans for our URL Shortener service. The document aims to guide the development, testing, and deployment processes to ensure seamless integration and rapid delivery of features and bug fixes.

### CI Pipeline
1. Code Check-In: Developers will commit code to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Automated Trigger: Any push to the main branch or a pull request will automatically trigger the CI pipeline.
3. Static Code Analysis: Linting and static code checks to maintain code quality.
4. Build: Compile the source code, generate executables, and create Docker images.
5. Unit Testing: Run unit tests to validate the functionality of the new code.
6. Integration Testing: Test the interactions between different pieces of code.
7. Artifact Storage: Store build artifacts like Docker images for deployment.
8. Notifications: Send notifications about the build and test status.

### CD Pipeline
1. Automated Trigger: Triggered automatically after successful CI or manually by developers.
2. Deployment to Staging: Deploy the new build to a staging environment.
3. Smoke Testing: Basic tests to ensure the staging environment is working.
4. Approval: Manual approval to move to production.
5. Deployment to Production: Deploy the approved build to the production environment.
6. Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring of the application's performance and errors.
7. Rollback Strategy: If anything goes wrong, rollback to the previous stable version.

## Deployment Plans
- Initial Deployment: Dockerized application will be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Scaling: Automated scaling using Kubernetes.
- Updates: Zero-downtime deployments to ensure service continuity.
