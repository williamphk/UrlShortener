# Deployment Plan Document
This document outlines the deployment plan for our web application. It covers the initial deployment strategy, scaling considerations, and update protocols to ensure the efficient and reliable running of the service in production.

## Environment
- Platform: Kubernetes
- Cloud Provider: AWS/Google Cloud/Azure

## Deployment Plan
1. ### Initial Deployment
Dockerized application will be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Pull the latest Docker image from the artifact storage.
- Configure Kubernetes deployment YAML with the image and necessary environment variables.
- Apply the Kubernetes deployment to roll out the application.
- Validate the deployment by checking pod status and service endpoints.

2. ### Scaling
Automated scaling using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Monitor CPU and Memory usage metrics via Prometheus.
- Set up a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale pods based on CPU or Memory.
- Test scaling by simulating increased load and observing the addition or removal of pods.

3. ### Updates
Zero-downtime deployments to ensure service continuity.
- Pull the latest Docker image for the update.
- Update the Kubernetes deployment YAML with the new image.
- Roll out the update using Kubernetes rolling updates.
- Monitor the application and rollback if any issues are detected.

4. ### Monitoring & Logging
Use cloud-native solutions for real-time monitoring and alerting. Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization. Fluentd and Elasticsearch for logging.
- Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application and Kubernetes nodes.
- Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize these metrics.
- Configure Fluentd to aggregate logs from application pods.

# Real Production Service Considerations
## Database Mapping
The current implementation doesn't include a database for storing the mappings between the shortened URLs and the original URLs. It means that there is no way to revert the shortened URL back to the original URL. In a production scenario, a database is required to store the mappings between the randomised and encrypted strings and the original long URLs. This also allows for quick lookups, easy management of URL data, and also provides the capability to add additional features such as analytics or expiration dates for URLs. By using a database, we can also ensure that each randomised and encrypted string is unique by applying unique constraints at the database level. If there's a conflict (i.e., a generated string already exists), the service could either regenerate a new string or apply a slight modification to make it unique.

A production service will require some level of authentication to prevent abuse. For example, a simple API key-based or OAuth2-based authentication could be added to throttle usage and prevent abuse.
